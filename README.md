Trendulo
========
Trendulo is a sample application to show how [Apache Accumulo](http://incubator.apache.org/accumulo/) can be used to perform trending analytics. Currently, Trendulo is split into two project, one for data ingest, and the other a web app for querying Accumulo.
Trendulo supports ingesting Twitter status messages via the [Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api).

### NOTE
I have rushed to get a working version of Trendulo to demo at the [Boulder/Denver BigData Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Denver-Big-Data/events/55277392/) so there is ample room to improve the quality of code and documentation.
